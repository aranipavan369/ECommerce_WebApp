Q Why have we kept BaseModel as abstract class ?
A Coz, it's incomplete and we don't want to create object of that Base Abstract Class.
  We will extend that in other Models and use there.

Q Difference between @RestController and @Controller
A In our case, we are making requests on Postman, and Postman is fine with JSON/XML kind of
  responses. It's not a human, Human wants to see a view.
  So if your end goal is frontend calling your backend APIs and want to display view for that
  then use @Controller. Just for testing purpose, please stick to @RestController only.

Q Why used @Getter and @Setter and not @Data ?
A As per our usecase, we just wanted to include getters and setters that time.
  If in future, we would need ToString and RequiredArgsConstructor , then we will use @Data
  as @Data is mixture of all

Q What is HTTP Options Method ?
A suppose bar.com is making post request to foo.com to get some data form foo.com. Before this
  post request could be made browser will send an Options request to foo.com asking the permission
  to make a post request. If foo.com server identifies bar.com domain and allows bar.com to make
  a post request then the actual request will be make otherwise, you will see a 400 bad request
  error with reason as preflight failed.

Q Difference between DAO and DTO
A DAO acts as a bridge between the database and the application. DTO acts as a data store from where the data is received and transferred to different layers i.e.,
  to the DAO application.

Q Can we write @RestController("/products")
A We can , but it is not correct way, it will not work.
  If we want to specify route at Class Level , Put it inside @RequestMapping , like we did.
